## Description
This is the final project that I worked on as a part of Udacity's Front End Web Development Nanodegree program. The instructions for this project were to use my combined knowledge of HTML, CSS, and primarily JavaScript to make a static website interactive. Specifically I had to dynamically create a navigation menu, make a section scroll into view when I clicked the corresponding link, and to visually distinguish when a section is active or inactive (within or outside of the viewport) using class designation. I programmed 3 functions that carry out these actions, 2 of which are triggered by events. I also created an 'active' class in the CSS file to apply styling to a navigation link when it's corresponding section is active.

Other additions:
- Added 4 sections to the HTML file.
- Added scrollbar styling.

The original code is provided [here](https://github.com/udacity/cd0428-landing-page).

## Details
When navigating the project within a browser:
- When you click on a link, it will scroll to the corresponding section. The section will have a class of "your-active-class". Any previous active section will have this class removed.
- When you scroll, the section within the viewport will have a translucent background and animated circles and the corresponding link with be highlighted in light blue.
