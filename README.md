## Description
This is the final project that I worked on as a part of Udacity's Front End Web Development Nanodegree program. The instructions for this project were to use my combined knowledge of HTML, CSS, and primarily JavaScript to make a static website interactive. More specifically, my goal was to dynamically create a navigation menu, scroll to a section within the page when I clicked the corresponding link, and to visually distinguish when a section is active or inactive (within or outside of the viewport) using class designation. I programmed 3 functions that carry out these actions, 2 of which are triggered by events. I also created an 'active' class in the CSS file to apply styling to a navigation link when it's corresponding section is active. Lastly I added 4 sections to the HTML file to test my code. The rest of code was provided by [].

## Demo
-When you click on a link, it will scroll to the corresponding section.
-The section will have a class of "your-active-class"
-Any previous active section will have this class removed
-When you scroll, the section within the viewport will have a translucent background and animated circles and the corresponding link with be highlighted in light blue
